# How to contribute
The community is what makes We CMS great, without you we wouldn't have come so far. But to help us keep our sanity and reach code-nirvana together, please follow these quick rules whenever contributing.


## Opening issues
1. If you have a question about setting up/using We CMS, please check out the [We docs](https://github.com/we-cms/we/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) or try searching  [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/we-cms).
2. Search for issues similar to yours in [GitHub search](https://github.com/we-cms/we/search?type=Issues). 
3. If there's an open issue, please contribute to that issue.
4. If there's a closed issue, open a new issue and link the url of the already closed issue(s).
5. If there is no issue, open a new issue and specify the following:
  - A short description of your issue in the title
  - Detailed explanation of how to recreate the issue
6. If you are experiencing more than one problem, create a separate issue for each one. If you think they might be related, please reference the other issues you've created.



## Submitting Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo.
2. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need a test!
4. Make the tests pass and make sure you follow [our syntax guidelines](https://github.com/we-cms/we/blob/master/.jshintrc).
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to our [the development branch](https://github.com/we-cms/we/tree/development).
